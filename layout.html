            animal, (kingdom Animalia), any of a group of multicellular eukaryotic organisms (i.e., as
            distinct from bacteria, their deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is contained in a membrane-bound nucleus).
            <br>Animals dominate human conceptions of life on Earth not simply by their size, abundance, and sheer
            diversity but also by their mobility, a trait that humans share. So integral is movement to the conception
            of animals that sponges, which lack muscle tissues, were long considered to be plants.
        </div>
        <div id="right"><strong>Animal diversity</strong><br>
            The diverse appearance of animals is mostly superficial; the bewildering variety of known forms, some truly
            bizarre, can be assorted among a mere half-dozen basic body plans.<br> These plans are established during
            the
            embryonic stages of development and limit the size and complexity of the animals.<br> Symmetry, number and
            relative development of tissue layers, presence and nature of body cavities, and several aspects of early
            development define these fundamental modes of organization.</div>

        <div id="right1"><strong>Animals are multicellular</strong> <br>
            Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few
            exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can
            reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. As
            of 2022, 2.16 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects,
            over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates—but it has been estimated there are around 7.77
            million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres
            (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food
            webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. <br>
            <br><strong>Etymology</strong>
            <hr>
            The word "animal" comes from the Latin animalis, meaning 'having breath', 'having soul' or 'living being'.
            The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.In colloquial usage, the term animal
            is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals. The term "metazoa" is derived from the Ancient Greek μετα
            (meta, meaning "later") and ζῷᾰ (zōia, plural of ζῷον zōion, meaning animal).
